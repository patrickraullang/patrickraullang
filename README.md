### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

Welcome to my corner of GitHub! Here's a sneak peek into my digital playground:

ğŸ”­ Currently weaving my magic on 2 projects outside university and conjuring up another for my master's degree.
ğŸŒ± Hoping to cultivate my skills in web development and cloud architecture.
ğŸ˜„ Still a ways off from being the coding wizard I aspire to be, but hey, the journey's half the fun, right?
